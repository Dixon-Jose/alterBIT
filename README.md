# alterBIT   [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/your/repo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/your/repo)

Web Application to find alternatives.

The latest trend  of using unconventional resources shouldn't stop at large projects like fuel for car or electricity. We can find alternatives for even the smallest of things, be it applications we use, medicines we take, and  the ingredients we cook. There are always some alternatives present which can work in the same if not a better way, while  being cheaper and more accessible. AlterBIT aims to provide information about these unsung heroes.

Alter-bit will provide two services to its users. The first will be to provide our own set of verified alternatives to the users. The Second is to get information about these alternatives from the users, verify them, and then put it out for the entire world to use.

The first service will be provided in the following way: Short descriptions to these alternatives will be provided, i.e. their images, uncommon usages, feature etc. Also, links will be provided with the description to make them accessible to the users. They can then rate, comment and give their feedback about the usage of these alternatives. If any product doesn't work out the way it was put up to be then the product will be removed until verified again.

The second service will be provided in the following way: Information about the alternatives will be taken from users, inputs will be categorized, and then put up for verification. Once the product is verified by registered users they will be put up on the website.

AlterBIT aims to build a better and more efficient world where conventional resources won't have the spotlight and unconventional will be the way of life.
